# CovDetect
This tool analyzes network packet captures (.pcap/.pcapng files) to detect possible covert channels. It evaluates packet fields like TTL, TCP sequence numbers, IP IDs, payload sizes, and inter-packet delays.  It generates visual graphs, entropy scores, CSV summaries, and a plain text report for every analysis.
